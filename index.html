                For the past 7 years at Creative Destruction Lab and beyond, I've worked with technical founders in frontier fields. My role was to help de-risk their brilliant but uncertain innovations—working hands-on with founders to translate breakthrough science into investment-ready ventures. Over weeks and months, I shaped investor narratives, refined GTM strategies, validated business models, and facilitated the partnerships with world-class scientists, mentors, and investors that accelerated their path from hypothesis to viable business.

They don't know their market, can't articulate value propositions to investors, and struggle to identify the right partnerships to scale.

                        I’m equally comfortable in a room of academic researchers, policymakers, corporate partners, and investors. I’ve co-written technical roadmaps with scientists, turned them into compelling investor narratives, and presented strategies that win both capital and adoption.

                        X's Business Innovation team needs to systematically accelerate moonshots from earliest stages to investable ventures. I've already done this at scale — building repeatable processes for market validation, partnership facilitation, and investment readiness across hundreds of deep tech startups.
